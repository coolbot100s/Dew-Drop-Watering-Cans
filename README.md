## Dew Drop: Watering Cans

Adding Stardew Valley inspired watering cans to Minecraft.  
This simple mod adds a standard set of watering cans that are primarily used to water crops.
This mod was designed specifically for Dew Drop project and works great in any survival world, but we reccomend pairing it with [Dew Drop: Sturdy Farmland]() and [Dew Drop: Daily Weather]() for the full experience!

### Watering Cans
Bored with farmland magically becoming "watered" from being near a water block? Now you can use your own watering cans satiate your beloved crops!  
Watering Cans are made with a full bucket of water, and your material of choice, Netherite Watering Cans need to be upgraded using an upgrade template.
Personally, I find this mechanic to be much more immersive and cozy.  

### Abilities
Iron+ Watering Cans will also have a "Super" ability, start using your watering can while crouching to charge it up and water a large area all at once!
The higher tier of watering can you have, the more maximum charge, and bigger area you can water!   

### Refilling
Don't forget you'll need to refill your watering can from time to time, simply use the can on some water to do so.  
If you want your watering cans to have infinite water, you can give the item the Unbreakable tag.

### Speed up crop growth
Bonemeal too expensive and tedious for you? Watering Cans that speed up crops are a staple in modded minecraft, so this feature can be found here too.
By default there's a chance crops watered with your watering can will grow faster!  


### Water in the nether?
While you won't be able to use your watering cans to start that perfect nether base right away, the Netherite Watering Can is able to keep your water from evaporating just long enough you can water your crops even in the harshest environments.  

### Become a firefighter!
Dew Drop's watering cans have a few special interactions with other blocks, like the ability to douse fires.  
There are a few others, and we'd love to add more, so stay curios and feel free to send us your suggestions!  

## Config
You can change the size and shape of each watering can's ability range in the.  
You can also change the liklihood of bonemeal.
Allow use of all or no watering cans in the nether.
and configure other special interactions, all controlled by the [server config]().
