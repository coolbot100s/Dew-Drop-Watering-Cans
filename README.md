## Dew Drop: Watering Cans

Adding Stardew Valley inspired watering cans to Minecraft.  
This simple mod adds a standard set of watering cans that are primarily used to water crops.
This mod was designed specifically for Dew Drop project and works great in any survival world, but we reccomend pairing it with [Dew Drop: Sturdy Farmland]() and `Coming Soon™️` for the full experiance!


### Watering Cans
Bored of farmland magically becoming "watered" from being near a water block? Now you can use your own watering cans satiate your beloved crops!  
Watering Cans are made with a full bucket of water, and your material of choice, Netherite Watering Cans need to be upgraded using an upgrade template.
Personally, I find this mechanic to be much more immersive and cozy.  

### Abilities
Iron+ Watering Cans will also have a "Super" ability, start using your watering can while crouching to charge it up and water a large area all at once!
The higher tier of watering can you have, the more maximum charge, and bigger area you can water!   
The range of each ability can be changed in the [server_config]().

### Refilling
Don't forget you'll need to refill your watering can from time to time, simply use the can on some water to do so.  
If you want your watering cans to have infinite water, you can give the item the Unbreakable tag.
